## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Discord
- Allows users to create servers with multiple voice channels
- Saves all old messages
- Allows developers to create new bots to implement features

Snapchat
- Images are only allowed to be viewed twice
- Messages are deleted after viewing

Bilibili
- Users can change the volume and brightness by swiping on the video
- Users can hold the right side of the video to speed up

I'd like to build an application that will help users grow plants. Some features I was thinking of
include allowing users to identify plants by using their iPhone's camera, being able to save a list of plants,
and tracking the plants growth or give tips on how to make it grow better. Perhaps even a forum where
people can post or ask about different plant growing experiences.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

It was my first time using Storyboard (I used SwiftUI before for iOS develpoment) so I spent some extra
time learning where certain components like the editor assistant were located.
